Rough UX plan - just some notes for myself

- Account system
- When logged in, you can
    - create songs
    - view your songs
    - edit your songs
- There should be one (very similar) view for both editing an existing song and creating a new song
- UI should also be very similar between viewing an existing song and editing it (smooth transitions)
- Songs should consist of independent sections (intro, verse, chorus etc.)
- Sections can include lyrics and chords (just chords for instrumental sections)
- Sections should be clonable and editable
- When editing section lyrics, the lyrics should change into a big text input box, populated by the lyrics of that section
- Not sure about how to do chords yet
